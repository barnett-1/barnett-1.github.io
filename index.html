<h1>Facial Recognition</h1>
<h3>What is facial recognition?</h3>

<p>Facial recognition is any algorithm that can accurately identify the face of an individual. Unlike facial detection, the accuracy of recognition relies on matching input to collected data. </p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>Modern facial recognition algorithms use deep learning, a subset of machine learning to identify faces. Deep learning relies on backpropagation, modern graphical processors and large sets of data to train models. Deep learning's neural networks have convolutional layers accept an input, multiply sections of the input by filter(s) at similar sizes to the sections resulting in products which are then summed to create a dot product. When this output is then used as input for another layer, a pattern begins to emerge.</p>

<h3>What are it's uses?</h3>

<p>Facial recognition has been used in law enforcement and in technologies like smartphones for positive identification. Law enforcement can use facial recognition to identify people involved in crime, namely suspects, victims, and witnesses. In the tech sector, companies are implementing this technology for authorization such as permissions for phones, payment processing, and the entering of areas where classified information resides. </p>

<h3>It it ethical?</h3>

<p>There is a debate currently around how facial recognition should be used. The main disadvantage of facial recognition is that it curtails privacy, which implies a loss of freedom. Others disagree, stating that there is not a reasonable expectation of privacy in public and that the advantages outweigh the downsides. </p>

<h3>It is secure?</h3>

<p>Like everything else, facial recognition is not completely secure. Some of the data sets used in facial recognition are deliberately open to the public, however, others are inaccessible even though they are compiled from public sources. </p>

<h3>How will it affect society?</h3>

<p>Facial recognition, depending on how it's used, could be a blessing or a curse. There is no doubt that bad actors will use facial recognition to target innocent people, but it could also save other affected by crime. It may be used in ways we haven't even conceived of. </p>

<h3>What's it's future?</h3>

<p>Right now facial recognition is foreign and a growing trend. There is no way to be sure of how we decide to use it, but it's most likely here to stay. Future generations might not think twice about the implementation of facial recognition, and treat there faces like an identification card. </p>
